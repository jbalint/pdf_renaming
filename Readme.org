PDF Renaming - A utility to assist in renaming sets of PDF files.

* What it does
  PDF renaming assists in renaming PDF files based on content.
  A subset of the content of the file is shown in a way that can be edited
  to give the new title for the PDF file.
* Requirements
  + =pdftotext= provided by poppler (PDF rendering library based on xpdf 3.0)
	+ Can provide poor results
  + GhostScript
* How it works
** PDF to text is provided by GhostScript. The command is invoked as:
   =gs -q -dNODISPLAY -P- -dSAFER -dDELAYBIND -dWRITESYSTEMDICT -dSIMPLE -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=1 -c save -f ps2ascii.ps connector-semantics.pdf -c quit=
   + This was obtained by looking at =ps2ascii= and adding the page restrictions.
